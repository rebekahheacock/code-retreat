  # this is where we decided to make module for logic, seemed like after last nights
  # study breaking up things into small bits is best practice

  # yeah agreed
  # our thinking was 1) find the neighbors (some cells have 8, some have <8)
  # 2) check the neighbors & count up living
  # 3) change the status
  # tricky part is if you change the status of cell[2,3] right away, then the neighbor of that cell
  # will find a new value for [2,3] when it checks 
  # not sure how to handle?

  # I think you can put 2 values into cell.  Status & new status, only having read the status when determining
  # new status.  And on new iteration setting status to "new status" at beginning of turn.  Names sound bad now

# the only inputs would be world size and the clicks before game yes?

# we had board take a height & widht (though could just be "size" fo ra square)

# cells took an x and y coordinate

# board was set up as nested arrayâ€”an array of rows, and each row contains an array of cells

class Board
  def initialize(size)
    @size = size
    @cells = []
  end

  def fill_with_cells
    # loop through size, and create a row array for each #
    # loop through again and fill with that many cells
    # push the row array into the @cells array
    # nested arrays would have x & y & status or where would status eventually be 

   # neighbor = x + 1, y || y+1 || y-1
   # what function would be used to dive into neighbors to count up living?
